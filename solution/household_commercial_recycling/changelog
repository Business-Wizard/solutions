CHANGE original excel sheet
Sheet: Variable Meta-analysis
Cell: K779
Old value: kg CO2/t
New value: Original Units

CHANGE original excel sheet
Sheet: Custom PDS Adoption
Cells: B56, B490,
Old value: zh
New value: copy-paste the formula from the adjacent cell

REMOVE the following scenarios. They're missing from the 'Custom PDS Adoption' sheet.
- PDS1-65p2050-Medium Prognostication (Book Ed.1)
- PDS1-65p2050-Medium Prognostication (Updated)

(Paraphrasing: the original conversation has images:
They encountered issues with inconsistency between Excel and Python with the LINEST function)

I think having 3 data points for this order 3 polynomial is asking a lot of precision from not a lot of data.

We're open to any suggestions for the next steps.

Denton's reply:
I have notes from one other time this happened, while importing AlternativeCements_v1.1c_IntegrationJune2020.xlsm.
I think I ended up pulling in an Excel file of data to sidestep the problem altogether: 
https://github.com/ProjectDrawdown/solutions/blob/develop/solution/altcement/data.xlsx

The notes from the time are that sklearn's linear regression least squares implementation produced closer 
results to Excel, but still not within a floating point margin of error sufficient to produce the same
result. My belief was that Excel's LINEST was also operating in an unstable region but just didn't say so.

C Poe:
It seems if we add one more row of data, our LINEST() and np.polyfit() functions compute the same coefficients.
