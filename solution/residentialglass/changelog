Setting specific parameters for Helper Tables and Unit Adoption were what it
took to get it working:
Helper Tables:
    use_first_pds_datapoint_main=True,
    use_first_ref_datapoint_main=False,
    copy_pds_to_ref=False,
    copy_ref_datapoint=False,
    copy_pds_datapoint='Ref Table',
    copy_datapoint_to_year=2014,
Unit Adoption:
    replacement_period_offset=0

Deleted 2/3 of the scenarios.  Some were known to be broken, and generally it wasn't
clear that they were useful.
